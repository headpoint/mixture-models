# Finite Mixture Models
Mixture models are used in many areas for clustering of data.
With mixutre models, clustering is done by estimating the density
of the data using a mixutre of component densities.
These components corresponds to the clusters in the data.
In mathematical form, mixture model estimates the density of a
$p$-dimensional observation as,
$$ f(\mathbf{y}; \Psi) = \sum_{i = 1}^g \pi_i f_i (\mathbf{y} | \mathbf{\theta}_i), \qquad \textrm{for} \, (i = 1, \dots, g),$$
where $f_i$'s are the component density functions,
parameterised by $\theta_i$, and $\pi_i$ are the mixture proportions
with $\sum_i^g \pi_i = 1$. $\mathbf{\Psi}$ contain the
paramters $\mathbf{\theta}_i$ ($i = 1, \dots, g$) and
$\pi_i$ ($i = 1, \dots, n-1$).


Usually, $f_i$ are taken to be from the same familiy of multivariate
distributions.
Mixutre models with components from the familiy of
normal / Gaussian are usually called Gaussian mixute models or
GMMs.
The paramaters $\mathbf{\theta}_i$  for a normal
distribution include the mean ($\mathbf{\mu}$) and
$\mathbf{\Sigma}$.


# Clustering Using Mixture Models

There are a number of `R` packages exists for fitting
mixutre models. Some of these include
`EMMIX`, `mixtools`, among others.

The Iris data is used a lot in demosntrating clustering algorithms.
This data contain measurements in centimeters of the variables
sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively,
for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris.
The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(ggplot2)
require(GGally)
ggpairs(iris, columns = 1:4,
        upper = list(continuous = "density", combo = "box_no_facet"),
        aes(colour = Species), size = 3)
```

## EMMIX
With **EMMIX** we can use following to
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(EMMIX)
fit <- EMMIX(dat = iris[, -5], g = 3)
```

By default, **EMMIX** fits mixture of normals to
data.
The output of EMMIX, contain
the estimates $\pi_i$, $\mathbf{\mu}_i$ and $\mathbf{\Sigma}_i$
are given in `fit$pro`, `fit$mu` and `fit$sigma`, respectively,
as well as criteria for model selection.

Given that we are already know the classification of
the Iris species in the data, we can check how
good the clustering is by comparing the implied
clustering with those. The adjusted Rand Index is a
good choise for this, but here we can juse use a
confuction matrix simply using the `table` function in R.
```{r}
table(fit$clust, iris[, 5])
```

We can also observe the clustering in a paired plot.
```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(iris, clust = factor(fit$clust))
ggpairs(df, columns = 1:4,
        upper = list(continuous = "density", combo = "box_no_facet"),
        aes(colour = clust))
```


We can use the `plot_contour` function
available in  https://github.com/headpoint/misc
to plot the coutours of the componets.
The countous does not account for the
mixture proportions.

```{r}
plot_contous(fit)
```
